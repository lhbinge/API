@article{DeZwart2011,
abstract = {Differentiating between various types of colonies in order to explain their divergent paths of economic development is commonplace among economists and economic historians. Recently, specialists of African economic history have drawn attention to the more adverse economic effects of colonial rule in the so-called settler societies. These colonies were not only characterised by a more persistent form of inequality, but also by comparatively low and stagnant living standards for the native population. Employing data from the British colonial statistics, wage and price levels were established and used to compute real wages in South Africa - Africa's prime settler colony - between 1835 and 1910. These show a rising real wage trend for Europeans in South Africa, while the material wellbeing of the 'coloured' workers did not improve; racial inequality thus increased during the 19th century. In addition, wage differentials between skilled and unskilled labourers reveal a high and rising skill premium, indicating a shortage of human capital. Global comparisons demonstrate that South African real wages were on a par with Europe and higher than in Asia. Finally, it is shown that Africans were not necessarily better off in non-settler societies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Recent studies show that uncertainty shocks have quantitatively important effects on the real economy. This paper examines one particular channel at work: the supply of credit. It presents a model in which a bank, even if managed by risk-neutral shareholders and subject to limited liability, can exhibit self-insurance, and thus loan supply contracts when uncertainty increases. This prediction is tested with the universe of U.S. commercial banks over the period 1984-2010. Identification of credit supply is achieved by looking at the differential response of banks according to their level of capitalization. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, increases in uncertainty reduce the supply of credit, more so for banks with lower levels of capitalization. These results are weaker for large banks, and are robust to controlling for the lending and capital channels of monetary policy, to different measures of uncertainty, and to breaking the dataset in subsamples. Quantitatively, uncertainty shocks are almost as important as monetary policy ones with regards to the effects on the supply of credit.},

That decline was similar for all age and sex cohorts and thus did not reflect expected emancipation without compensation. The decision to secede reflected beliefs that the North would not invade and that emancipation without compensation was unlikely. Both were encouraged by Lincoln's conciliatory tone before the attack on Fort Sumter, and subsequently dashed by Lincoln's willingness to wage all-out war. (JEL D72, D74, D83, G14, H77, N31, N41)},

abstract = {The extraordinary events surrounding the Great Recession have cast a considerable doubt on the traditional sources of macroeconomic instability. In their place, economists have singled out financial and uncertainty shocks as potentially important drivers of economic fluctuations. Empirically distinguishing between these two types of shocks, however, is difficult because increases in economic uncertainty are strongly associated with a widening of credit spreads, an indication of a tightening in financial conditions. This paper uses the penalty function approach within the SVAR framework to examine the interaction between financial conditions and economic uncertainty and to trace out the impact of these two types of shocks on the economy. The results indicate that (1) financial shocks have a significant adverse effect on economic outcomes and that such shocks were an important source of cyclical fluctuations since the mid-1980s; (2) uncertainty shocks, especially those implied by uncertainty proxies that do not rely on financial asset prices, are also an important source of macroeconomic disturbances; and (3) uncertainty shocks have an especially negative economic impact in situations where they elicit a concomitant tightening of financial conditions. Evidence suggests that the Great Recession was likely an acute manifestation of the toxic interaction between uncertainty and financial shocks.},

abstract = {This study evaluates five mathematical and five statistical methods for temporal disaggregation in an attempt to select the most suitable method(s) for routine compilation of sub-annual estimates through temporal distribution and interpolation in the national accounts at BEA. The evaluation is conducted using 60 series of annual data from the National Economic Accounts, and the final sub-annual estimates are evaluated according to specific criteria to ensure high quality final estimates that are in compliance with operational policy at the national accounts. The study covers the cases of temporal disaggregation when 1) both annual and sub-annual information is available; 2) only annual data are available; 3) sub-annual estimates have both temporal and contemporaneous constraints; and 4) annual data contain negative values. The estimation results show that the modified Denton proportional first difference method outperforms the other methods, though the Casey-Trager growth preservation model is a close competitor in certain cases. Lagrange polynomial interpolation procedure is inferior to all other methods. {\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_} I would like to express our great appreciation to Pierre Cholette from Statistics Canada, David Findley and Brian Monsell from the Census Bureau, Roberto Barcellan from Eurostats, and Nils Maehle from the MIF for providing us the software programs and related documentations used in the estimation experiment and for their helpful discussions on the subject.

abstract = {This paper examines asymmetries in the impact of monetary policy on the middle segment of the South African housing market from 1966:M2 to 2011:M12. We use Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model in which parameters change according to the phase of the housing cycle. The results suggest that monetary policy is not neutral as house price growth decreases substantially with a contractionary monetary policy. We find that the impact of monetary policy is larger in bear regime than in bull regime; indicating the role of information asymmetry in reinforcing the financial constraint of economic agents. As expected, monetary policy reaction to a positive house price shock is found to be stronger in the bull regime. This suggests that the central bank reacts more in bull regime in order to prevent potential crisis related to the subsequent bust in house prices bubbles which are more prominent in bull markets. These results substantiate important asymmetries in the dynamics of house prices in relation to monetary policy, vindicating the advantages of generating regime dependent impulse response functions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reviews some methodological and practical problems encountered in the construction of historical price indices. The underlying data sets in such studies are often characterized by heterogenous and incomplete price series. It is shown that by using the repeat sales method for constructing the subindices for individual commodity groups, some of the main problems can be overcome. The procedures are illustrated by material from the construction of monthly price indices for Norway from the year 1777 to 1920. The price indices shed new light on two great wartime inflationary episodes in Norway: 1807-17 and 1913-20. In spite of a 61-fold increase in the price level in the first period and a four-fold increase in the second, it is found that, after inflation had been brought under control, prices reverted to a level consistent with the purchasing power parity principle.},

abstract = {Standard housing price indexes rely on strong constant-quality assumptions and often conflict. Hedonic price indexes overcome limitations of median price and repeat-sales indexes but their implementation has been limited by a lack of data. This paper constructs hedonic indexes at the zip code level for the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas using considerably more detailed data than previously available. Our sample was collected by a mortgage technology firm, and consists of almost 1.1 million transactions during the boom-bust cycle since 2000. Our hedonic regressions include new spatial models that capture correlations within submarkets (using zip codes as proxies) and allow temporal asymmetry. Compared to a repeat-sales price index constructed from the same data, the hedonic indexes indicate that the market peaked about 11. months later in Los Angeles and about 2. months earlier in San Diego, show less pre-peak appreciation and post-peak depreciation in low-tier housing and more pre-peak appreciation in high-tier housing. We also find that the intensity of the cycle varies greatly across zip codes and price-tiers in a pattern consistent with foreclosure activity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

A large database was analysed consisting of more than 10,500 auction prices of Belgian paintings over the period 1970–97. These paintings are the auctioned oeuvre of 71 internationally recognised painters representing the main artistic schools (from social realism to surrealism) over the period 1850–1950. Hedonic art returns are corrected for auction location and auction house, artistic school, painters' reputation, medium, signature and painting size. Surrealism and luminism have been the most popular currents of art (in monetary terms), while expressionism and symbolism have gained (financial) esteem. This study concludes that art invest- ments underperform equity market investments owing to the high risk of investing in art and its high transaction costs, resale rights and insurance premia. In addition, the Markowitz efficient frontier shows limited diversification potential for art.},

abstract = {A number of studies by several economists have argued that dividend and stock price data are not consistent with the market fundamentals hypothesis, in which prices are given by the present discounted values of expected dividends. These results have often been construed as evidence for the existence of bubbles or fads. Related arguments have been made with respect to gold, bonds, and foreign exchange. A major problem with such arguments is that apparent evidence for bubbles can be reinterpreted in terms of market fundamentals that are unobserved by the researcher. Economists have recommended the alternative strategy of testing for rational bubbles by investigating the stationarity properties of asset prices and observable fundamentals. In essence, the argument for equities is that if stock prices are not more explosive than dividends then it can be concluded that rational bubbles are not present, since they would generate an explosive component to stock prices. This article shows that the above battery of tests is in fact unable to detect an important class of rational bubbles. The point is demonstrated by constructing rational bubbles that appear to be stationary when unit-root tests are applied, even though they are explosive in the relevant sense.},

We find that the demand for art by Japanese collectors is positively correlated with art prices and Japanese stock prices. This correlation is magnified during the "bubble period" of the Japanese economy (the mid-1980s to the early 1990s) and gains even further strength for works of art typically favored by Japanese collectors. Our results suggest that Japanese investors (or Japanese asset markets) indeed affect international art prices-especially during the bubble period and its aftermath.},

This stands in sharp contrast to the perceived view that the Cape was an "economic and social backwater," a slave economy with slow growth and little progress. Following a national accounts framework, we find that Cape settlers' per capita income is similar to the most prosperous countries of the time--Holland and England. We trace the roots of this result, showing that it is partly explained by a highly skewed population structure and very low dependency ratio of slavery, and attempt to link the eighteenth-century Cape Colony experience to twentieth-century South African income levels.},

First, we argue for the output-gap view that the business cycle corresponds to transitory deviations in economic activity away from a permanent, or trend, level. Then we investigate the extent to which a general model-based approach to estimating trend and cycle for the U.S. economy leads to measures of the business cycle that reflect models versus the data. We find empirical support for a nonlinear time series model that produces a business cycle measure with an asymmetric shape across NBER expansion and recession phases. Specifically, this business cycle measure suggests that recessions are periods of relatively large and negative transitory fluctuations in output. However, several close competitors to the nonlinear model produce business cycle measures of widely differing shapes and magnitudes. Given this model-based uncertainty, we construct a mode...},

This model is composed of a fixed time effect and a random ZIP (postal) code effect combined with an autoregressive component. The former two components are applied to all home sales, while the latter is applied only to homes sold repeatedly. The time effect can be converted into a house price index. To evaluate the proposed model and the resulting index, single-family home sales for twenty US metropolitan areas from July 1985 through September 2004 are analyzed. The model is shown to have better predictive abilities than the benchmark S{\&}P/Case--Shiller model, which is a repeat sales model, and a conventional mixed effects model. Finally, Los Angeles, CA, is used to illustrate a historical housing market downturn.},

But what is the causal relationship between uncertainty and growth? To identify this we construct cross country panel data on stock market levels and volatility as proxies for the first and second moments of business conditions. We then use natural disasters, terrorist attacks and unexpected political shocks as instruments for our stock market proxies of first and second moment shocks. We find that both the first and second moments are highly significant in explaining GDP growth, with second moment shocks accounting for at least a half of the variation in growth. Variations in higher moments of stock market returns appear to have little impact on growth.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the price determinants and investment performance of art. We apply a hedonic regression analysis to a new data set of more than one million auction transactions of paintings and works on paper. Based on the resulting price index, we conclude that art has appreciated in value by a moderate 3.97{\%} per year, in real U.S. dollar terms, between 1957 and 2007. This is a performance similar to that of corporate bonds--at much higher risk. A repeat-sales regression on a subset of the data demonstrates the robustness of our index. Next, quantile regressions document larger average price appreciations (and higher volatilities) in more expensive price brackets. We also find variation in historical returns across mediums and movements. Finally, we show that measures of high-income consumer confidence and art market sentiment predict art price trends.

The problem of combining price relatives of repent sales of properties to obtain a price index can be converted into a regression problem, and standard techniques of regression analysis can be used to estimate the index. This method of estimation is more efficient than others for combining price relatives in that it utilizes information about the price index for earlier periods contained in sales prices in later periods. Standard errors of the estimated index numbers can be readily computed using the regression method, and it permite certain effects on the value of real properties to be eliminated from the index.},

@article{Phillips2012,
abstract = {dentifying and dating explosive bubbles when there is periodically collapsing behavior over time has been a major concern in the economics literature and is of great importance for practitioners. The complexity of the nonlinear structure inherent in multiple bubble phenomena within the same sample period makes econometric analysis particularly difficult. The present paper develops new recursive procedures for practical implementation and surveillance strategies that may be employed by central banks and fiscal regulators. We show how the testing procedure and dating algorithm of Phillips, Wu and Yu (2011, PWY) are affected by multiple bubbles and may fail to be consistent. The present paper proposes a generalized version of the sup ADF test of PWY to address this difficulty, derives its asymptotic distribution, introduces a new date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles, and proves consistency of this dating procedure. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. Empirical applications are conducted to S{\&}P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach identifies many key historical episodes of exuberance and collapse over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and the CUSUM procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

Faced with under-performing portfolios, investors are continually seeking alternative assets and sophisticated solutions to reap high returns while minimizing risk. This previously nontransparent market is becoming more accessible via the increasing availability of indices and data on the art market. Additionally, art funds offer investors the opportunity to invest indirectly into the art market. Indirect investment into the art market results in losing the aesthetic pleasure from holding the art; however, financial gains can be made through pooling resources with the help of experts while gaining from diversification benefits. The art fund market is still in its infancy. There are few alternatives, and these are only available to investors willing to invest at a substantial level. Entry levels are at present still high. In time, these funds may become more accessible to the mainstream investor through pooling joint interests. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper develops a new approach to the problem of testing the existence of a level relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors, when it is not known with certainty whether the underlying regressors are trend- or first-difference stationary. The proposed tests are based on standard F- and t-statistics used to test the significance of the lagged levels of the variables in a univariate equilibrium correction mechanism. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics are non-standard under the null hypothesis that there exists no level relationship, irrespective of whether the regressors are I0 or I1. Two sets of asymptotic critical values are provided: one when all regressors are purely I1 and the other if they are all purely I0. These two sets of critical values provide a band covering all possible classifications of the regressors into purely I0, purely I1 or mutually cointegrated. Accordingly, various bounds testing procedures are proposed. It is shown that the proposed tests are consistent, and their asymptotic distribution under the null and suitably defined local alternatives are derived. The empirical relevance of the bounds procedures is demonstrated by a re-examination of the earnings equation included in the UK Treasury macroeconometric model.},

More precisely, it asks how reality in the form of empirical evidence does or does not influence economic thinking and theory. In particular, which role do calibration, statistical inference, and structural change play? What is the current state of affairs, what are the successes and failures, what are the challenges? I shall tackle these questions moving from general to specific. For the general perspective, I examine the following four points of view. First, economics is a science. Second, economics is an art. Third, economics is a competition. Forth, economics is politics. I then examine four specific cases for illustration and debate. First, is there a Phillips curve? Second, are prices sticky? Third, does contractionary monetary policy lead to a contraction in output? Forth, what causes business cycles? The general points as well as the specific cases each have their own implication for the central question at hand. Armed with this list of implications, I shall then attempt to draw a summary conclusion and provide an overall answer. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc..},

In$\backslash$naddition, the paper finds no evidence for convergence in small$\backslash$nmiddle-segment house prices. This suggests the existence of a national$\backslash$nmarket for large and possibly middle-segment houses in metropolitan$\backslash$nareas, but separate metropolitan markets for small middle-segment$\backslash$nhouses. In addition, the paper estimates the speed of convergence and$\backslash$nfinds that large middle-segment house prices converge within two to$\backslash$nseven quarters, while the speed of convergence for medium middle-segment$\backslash$nhouse prices in three of the five areas is five to eight quarters.},

@article{Phillips2011,
abstract = {A recursive test procedure is suggested that provides a mechanism for testing explosive behavior, date-stamping the origination and collapse of economic exuberance, and providing valid confidence intervals for explosive growth rates. The method involves the recursive implementation of a right-side unit root test and a sup test, both of which are easy to use in practical applications, and some new limit theory for mildly explosive processes. The test procedure is shown to have discriminatory power in detecting periodically collapsing bubbles, thereby overcoming a weakness in earlier applications of unit root tests for economic bubbles. Some asymptotic properties of the Evans (1991) model of periodically collapsing bubbles are analyzed and the paper develops a new model in which bubble duration depends on the strength of the cognitive bias underlying herd behavior in the market. The paper also explores alternative propagating mechanisms for explosive behavior based on economic fundamentals under time varying discount rates. An empirical application to the Nasdaq stock price index in the 1990s provides confirmation of explosiveness and date-stamps the origination of financial exuberance to June 1995, prior to the famous remark in December 1996 by Alan Greenspan about irrational exuberance in financial markets, thereby giving the remark empirical content.},

@phdthesis{Bester2010,
abstract = {In South Africa various financial institutions and independent vendors have developed residential property valuation models to estimate the current value of historically traded properties. A natural extension to these models has been to develop historical property price indices. In this dissertation, three of the four approaches to developing property price indices will be examined. Through back–testing and other statistical methods, the most accurate and robust approach will be determined. The four major approaches available are the mean valuation per suburb, the median valuation per suburb, the repeat sales approach and hedonic regression. The mean valuation per suburb approach can be biased because of outliers in property prices. However, outliers in property prices will not influence the median valuation per suburb approach, but in cases where property values in a suburb have a skewed distribution, the valuation amount could be distorted. Neither of the above mentioned shortcomings influences the repeat sales or the hedonic regression approach. To follow the hedonic regression approach, the characteristics of the property need to be known. In South Africa, however, the available property data lacks detailed characteristics of traded properties. This dissertation will therefore focus on the first three methods. The repeat sales approach measures the growth in property prices by applying a generalized linear model to properties that have traded more than once. This approach is only possible if there is a representative amount of repeat sales able to fit a model. The focus of this project will be on the repeat sales approach, but all three the approaches discussed will be analysed to prove that the repeat sales approach is the most accurate in developing a property price index for properties in South Africa.},

Art is also found to have lower volatility and lower correlation with other assets, making it more attractive for portfolio diversification than discovered in earlier research. There is strong evidence of underperformance of masterpieces, meaning expensive paintings tend to under- perform the art market index. The evidence is mixed on whether the "law of one price" holds in the New York auction market.},

The idea has a long history in the macroeconomic literature, as reflected by the work of Pigou (Industrial Fluctuation, MacMillan, London, 1926). The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate the type of general equilibrium structure that can give rise to such phenomena. Second, we examine the extent to which such a model can explain the observed pattern of U.S. recessions (frequency, depth) without relying on technological regress. We argue that such a model offer a framework for understanding elements of both the recent U.S. recession and of the Asia downturns of the late 1990s. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Uncertainty is an amorphous concept. It reflects uncertainty in the minds of consumers, managers, and policymakers about possible futures. It is also a broad concept, including uncertainty over the path of macro phenomena like GDP growth, micro phenomena like the growth rate of firms, and noneconomic events like war and climate change. In this essay, I address four questions about uncertainty. First, what are some facts and patterns about economic uncertainty? Both macro and micro uncertainty appear to rise sharply in recessions and fall in booms. Uncertainty also varies heavily across countries—developing countries appear to have about one-third more macro uncertainty than developed countries. Second, why does uncertainty vary during business cycles? Third, do fluctuations in uncertainty affect behavior? Fourth, has higher uncertainty worsened the Great Rec ession and slowed the recovery? Much of this discussion is based on research on uncertainty from the last five years, reflecting the recent growth of the literature.},

The business case is concerned with the primary question: What do the business community and organizations get out of CSR? That is, how do they benefit tangibly from engaging in CSR policies, activities and practices? The business case refers to the bottom-line financial and other reasons for businesses pursuing CSR strategies and policies. In developing this business case, the paper first provides some historical background and perspective. In addition, it provides a brief discussion of the evolving understandings of CSR and some of the long-established, traditional arguments that have been made both for and against the idea of business assuming any responsibility to society beyond profit-seeking and maximizing its own financial well-being. Finally, the paper addresses the business case in more detail. The goal is to describe and summarize what the business case means and to review some of the concepts, research and practice that have come to characterize this developing idea.},

This approach enables the researcher to use every single auction record, instead of only those auction records that belong to a sub-sample of selected artists. This results in a substantially larger sample available for research and it lowers the selection bias that is inherent in the traditional hedonic and repeat sales methodologies. Using a unique sample of 61,135 auction records for German artworks created by 5,115 different artists over the period 1985 to 2007, we find that the geometric annual return on German art is just 3.8 percent, with a standard deviation of 17.87 percent. Although our results indicate that art underperforms the market portfolio and is not proportionally rewarded for downside risk, under some circumstances art should be included in an optimal portfolio for diversification purposes.},

@article{Guo2014,
abstract = {Due to data and methodology constraints, there is a lack of good quality-controlled residential price indices publicly available in China. New home sales account for quite a large share of total home sales (87{\%} in 2010) in Chinese cities, As a result, the standard repeat sales approach cannot be employed, as a new housing unit only appears once on the market. The hedonic method may be more suitable in principle, but it is vulnerable to an omitted variables problem which may be more significant in Chinese cities due to extremely dynamic urban spatial structure development and fast infrastructure construction. Taking advantage of a unique feature of residential development in Chinese cities, we develop a “pseudo repeat sale” model (ps-RS) to construct more reliable quality-controlled price indices for newly-constructed homes. The new homes are developed in the form of residential complexes. Each complex is developed by a single developer and contains a number of high-rise residential buildings. Each housing unit within the same complex shares the same location and community attributes, as well as similar physical characteristics (such as structure type, architecture style, housing age, etc). Of course, there may still be important differences in unit size, number of bedrooms, floor level within the high-rise, and the direction the main bedroom faces. Based on specific criteria, we match two very similar new sales within a complex to create a “pseudo-pair.” We are able to generate a vast number of such pairs, many more than in traditional repeat sales models. By regressing the price differential onto the within-pair differentials in unit-specific physical attributes as well as the usual repeat-sales time dummy variables corresponding to the index periods (locational and community variables are cancelled out), we are able to construct a ps-RS price index for new homes. This ps-RS price index approach not only addresses the problem of lack of repeat-sales data and the omitted variables problem in the hedonic, but also addresses the traditional problems with the classical repeat-sales model in terms of small sample sizes or sample selection bias. Another advantage of this index is its transparency and ease of understandability for better communication with non-specialized constituencies (government and private sector policy makers, investors, and analysts). We test the approach using a large-scale micro transaction data set of new home sales from January 2005 to June 2011(469,070 observations) in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. We estimate our ps-RS indices and compare them with a corresponding standard hedonic index. The two indexes show similar overall price appreciation patterns, but the ps-RS index has less volatility and larger first-order autocorrelation than the hedonic index, suggesting that the ps-RS exhibits less random estimation error. The ps-RS approach may be suitable for any rapidly urbanizing country in which new home sales dominate the housing market and where the new housing stock is constructed in large-scale complexes consisting of many relatively homogeneous individual units.},

Using a large database of prices by state of agricultural commodities, we find that dispersion fell for many commodities until the First World War. We demonstrate that this reflected changes in transport costs which in turn in the long run depended on productivity growth in railroads. The year 1920 marked a change in this relationship, however, and between the First and Second World Wars we find considerable disintegration of agricultural markets, ultimately as a consequence of the 1920 Transportation Act. We argue that this benefited railroad companies in the 1920s and workers in the 1930s, and we put forward an estimate of the welfare losses for the consumers of railroad services (that is, agricultural producers and final consumers).},

abstract = {This paper examines the housing-output growth nexus in South Africa by accounting for the time variation in the causal link with a bootstrapped rolling Granger non-causality test. We use quarterly data on real gross domestic product, real house prices, real gross fixed capital formation and number of building plans passed. Our data span 1971Q2-2012Q2. Using full sample bootstrap Granger causality tests, we find a uni-directional causality from output to number of building plans passed; a uni-directional causality from real house price to output and a bi-directional causal link between residential investment and output. However, using parameter stability tests, we show that estimated VARs are unstable, thus full-sample Granger causality inference may be invalid. Hence, we use a bootstrap rolling window estimation to evaluate Granger causality between the housing variables and the growth rate. In general, we find that the causality from housing to output and, vice versa, differ across different sample periods due to structural changes. Specifically speaking, house price is found to have the strongest causal relationship with output compared to residential investment and number of building plans passed, with real house price showing predictive ability in all but one downward phase of the business cycle during this period. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Policy Modeling.},

Despite this, economic sentiment is often neglected by mainstream economics. This article assesses whether there is a potential role for economic sentiment to amplify business cycle fluctuations. This paper integrates the European Commission Economic Sentiment Indicator data into an econometric analysis of the euro area business cycle. The investigation of the euro area economy suggests that sentiment shocks do have an impact on important macroeconomic variables such as output, retail sales, and unemployment. There is furthermore significant evidence that economic conditions and shocks affect economic sentiment.},

abstract = {We construct measures of the annual cost of single-family housing for 46 metropolitan areas in the United States over the last 25 years and compare them with local rents and incomes as a way of judging the level of housing prices. Conventional metrics like the growth rate of house prices, the price-to-rent ratio, and the price-to-income ratio can be misleading because they fail to account both for the time series pattern of real long-term interest rates and predictable differences in the long-run growth rates of house prices across local markets. These factors are especially important in recent years because house prices are theoretically more sensitive to interest rates when rates are already low, and more sensitive still in those cities where the long-run rate of house price growth is high. During the 1980s, our measures show that houses looked most overvalued in many of the same cities that subsequently experienced the largest house price declines. We find that from the trough of 1995 to 2004, the cost of owning rose somewhat relative to the cost of renting, but not, in most cities, to levels that made houses look overvalued.},

Share issuance plays a bigger role than debt issuance in causing these effects.

While news, animal spirits, and pure noise all contribute to confidence innovations, the relationship between confidence and subsequent activity is almost entirely reflective of the news component. Confidence innovations are well characterized as noisy measures of changes in expected productivity growth over a relatively long horizon. (JEL D12, D83, D84, E12)},

Our justification for producing yet an-other paper on this subject is to reemphasize fundamentals. We focus on the basic building blocks—asking questions about what the underlying target is, how repeat sales goes about estimating the target, and when a particular index might be used in practice—rather than on more complex, higher level concerns such as statistical or modeling accuracy. We find that much of the debate over index methodology can be distilled to implicit and largely unrecognized disagreement over the desired target or the intended application. Consequently, we contend that paying greater heed to fundamental questions offers significant rewards to both researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Of the components of GDP, residential investment offers by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming recession. Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy. A modified Taylor Rule would depend on a long-term measure of inflation having little to do with the phase in the cycle, and, in place of Taylor's output gap, housing starts and the change in housing starts, which together form the best forward-looking indicator of the cycle of which I am aware. This would create pre-emptive anti-inflation policy in the middle of the expansions when housing is not so sensitive to interest rates, making it less likely that anti-inflation policies would be needed near the ends of expansions when housing is very interest rate sensitive, thus making our recessions less frequent and/or less severe.

abstract = {Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

abstract = {Sentiment or “animal spirits”has long been posited as an important determinant of asset prices, but measures of sentiment are difficult to construct and often confounded by asset fundamentals. This paper provides a first empirical test of the role of sentiment in the run-up and crash of housing prices that instigated the great financial crisis of 2008. I develop the first measures of sentiment across local housing markets by quantifying the positive and negative tone of housing news in local newspaper articles. I find that my housing sentiment index forecasts the boom and bust pattern of house prices at a two year lead, and can predict over 70 percent of the variation in aggregate house price growth. Consistent with theories of investor sentiment, I find that my sentiment index not only predicts price variation but also patterns in trading volume. Estimated effects of sentiment are robust to an extensive list of observed controls including lagged fundamentals, lagged price growth, subprime lending patterns, and news content over typically unobserved variables. To address potential bias from latent fundamentals, I develop instruments from a subset of weekend and narrative articles that newspapers use to cater to sentiment but are plausibly exogenous to news on fundamentals. Estimates remain robust to instrumental variable estimation, suggesting bias from unobserved fundamentals is minimal.},

abstract = {Many commentators argue that uncertainty about fiscal, monetary and regulatory policy slowed recovery from the 2007-2009 recession. To assess this view, we develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) that draws on the frequency of newspaper references to policy uncertainty and other indicators. Our index spikes near tight presidential elections, after the Gulf wars, 9/11 attack and Lehman Bros. bankruptcy, and during the 2011 debt ceiling debate. Several pieces of evidence and analysis – including a human audit of 4,300 newspaper articles – indicate that our EPU index offers a good proxy for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty over time. Using micro data, we investigate the effects of EPU on investment and hiring, finding negative effects for firms heavily exposed to government contracts. At the macro level, positive innovations in our EPU index foreshadow declines in investment, output and employment in VAR models. Extending our measurement efforts back to 1900, we find that EPU rose dramatically in the Great Depression, but only from 1932 onwards when Hoover and then Roosevelt initiated a period of intense policy activism. We also find a secular rise in policy uncertainty since the 1960s, coincident with government fiscal and regulatory expansion.},

After reading the article the reader should have a good understanding of the most important approaches, their shortcomings and advantages, and be able to make an informed judgment on which methods are most suitable for his or her purpose.

The problem of combining price relatives of repent sales of properties to obtain a price index can be converted into a regression problem, and standard techniques of regression analysis can be used to estimate the index. This method of estimation is more efficient than others for combining price relatives in that it utilizes information about the price index for earlier periods contained in sales prices in later periods. Standard errors of the estimated index numbers can be readily computed using the regression method, and it permite certain effects on the value of real properties to be eliminated from the index.},

The Russian art market exhibits positive correlations with most common financial assets and a positive market beta, whereas the Chinese art market demonstrates a negative correlation overall and a negative market beta, and the Indian art index reveals a negative market beta and varying correlation results. Portfolio optimization under a power utility framework suggests limited diversification potential, but with a downside beta of 0.43, investing in Chinese art offers hedging potential during financial market downswings. Investigating the linkages between art and the economy through co-integration and causality analyses proves that emerging art markets share a significant long-term relation with other financial market instruments, but short-term relations are largely absent. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {This paper models occasional, discrete shifts in the growth rate of a nonstationary series. Algorithms for inferring these unobserved shifts are presented, a byproduct of which permits estimation of parameters by maximum likelihood. An empirical application of this technique suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3 percent permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

With hedonic regression modeling we create an annual index that is based on 3,544 paintings created by 663 MENA artists. Our empirical results prove that investing in such a hypothetical index provides strong financial returns. While the results show an exponential growth in sales since 2006, the geometric annual return of the MENA art index is a stable13.9 percent over the whole period. We conclude that investing in MENA paintings would have been profitable but also note that we examined the performance of an emerging art market that has only seen an upward trend without any correction, yet.},
