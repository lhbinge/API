This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot [@Areal2013].

Blah blah [see @Areal2013, pp. 33-35; also @Ashenfelter2003, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@Ashenfelter2003, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@Ashenfelter2003; @Areal2013].
A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation.[^1] This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text:

Smith says blah [-@Areal2013].
You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

@Areal2013 says blah.

@Areal2013 [p. 33] says blah.

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
